{"name":"Poke","tagline":"Use poke, because touch lacks purpose.","body":"# poke\r\n\r\n_because touch lacks meaning_\r\n\r\n![demo](http://kevingleason.me/poke/demo.gif)\r\n\r\nPoke is a bash command, much like `touch` but with some brains to it. It is used\r\nto create a template for the programming language of your file.\r\n\r\n## Using poke\r\n\r\nIf you just want to see poke in action, clone the repository and call the poke\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\n\tgit clone https://github.com/GleasonK/poke.git\r\n\tcd poke/\r\n\t./poke Test.java\r\n\r\nNow, to use poke you have to do is add the poke folder to your `PATH` variable.\r\nIt is important that `poke` and `tmpl/` remain in the same folder.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n\tpoke [-lang|--flag] filename\r\n\r\nThe most basic usage is creating a new file, simply include the extension and if\r\nthere is a template, poke will use it.\r\n\r\n\tpoke FileName.ext\r\n\r\nFlags can be used to edit templates, or specify which template to use regardless\r\nof file extension. Available flags include:\r\n\r\n| Flag     | Description  |\r\n| -------- | ------------ |\r\n| -h\\|--help    | The full filename with extension |\r\n| --edit [lang] | The filename without extension   |\r\n| -j\\|--java    | Creates file with Java template  |\r\n| -c            | Creates file with C template     |\r\n| -cpp\\|--c++   | Creates file with C++ template   |\r\n| -cs\\|--c#     | Creates file with C# template    |\r\n| -f\\|--f#      | Creates file with F# template    |\r\n| -g\\|--go      | Creates file with Go template    |\r\n\r\nCurrently the following langauges have templates:\r\n\r\n- Java\r\n- C\r\n- C++\r\n- C#\r\n- F#\r\n- Go\r\n\r\nSome of these languages I do not use often, so templates are based off internet\r\nsearches, feel free to enhance them and submit a pull request!\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease do contribute to this repository, I only use so many languages so the\r\ntemplates I provide are probably not the best. However, creating or modifying\r\ntemplates is easy!\r\n\r\nThe poke script checks the file extension (Ex: Kevin__.java__) and looks for a \r\nmatching file poke__.java__ in the `/tmpl` folder. When making templates, you\r\nhave access to a few variables:\r\n\r\n| Variable  | Description |\r\n| --------- | ------------- |\r\n| $FILE     | The full filename with extension |\r\n| $FNAME    | The filename without extension   |\r\n| $TIME     | Time that the file was created   |\r\n\r\nSee [poke.java](https://github.com/GleasonK/poke/blob/master/tmpl/poke.java)\r\nfor a good example of template creation.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any suggestions for the future of this script!","google":"UA-46933211-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
