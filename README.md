# poke

_because touch lacks meaning_

![demo](http://kevingleason.me/poke/demo.gif)

Poke is a bash command, much like `touch` but with some brains to it. It is used
to create a template for the programming language of your file.

## Using poke

To install poke, clone the repository and install with the `Makefile`, using
`make install`.
	
	git clone https://github.com/GleasonK/poke.git
	cd poke/
	make install

If you just want to see poke in action, clone the repository and call the poke
command:

	git clone https://github.com/GleasonK/poke.git
	cd poke/
	./poke Test.java

## Usage

	poke [-lang|--flag] filename

The most basic usage is creating a new file, simply include the extension and if
there is a template, poke will use it.

	poke FileName.ext

Flags can be used to edit templates, or specify which template to use regardless
of file extension. Available flags include:

| Flag     | Description  |
| -------- | ------------ |
| -h\|--help    | The full filename with extension |
| --edit [lang] | The filename without extension   |
| --global [key] [val] | Save a global poke value (more below)   |
| -j\|--java    | Creates file with Java template  |
| -c            | Creates file with C template     |
| -cpp\|--c++   | Creates file with C++ template   |
| -cs\|--c#     | Creates file with C# template    |
| -f\|--f#      | Creates file with F# template    |
| -g\|--go      | Creates file with Go template    |

## Configuring Globals

	poke --global AUTHOR "Your Name"

Saves the author to a global config file. Now all $AUTHOR template variables
will be filled in with AUTHOR value.

## Templates

Currently the following langauges have templates:

- Java
- C
- C++
- C#
- F#
- Go

Some of these languages I do not use often, so templates are based off internet
searches, feel free to enhance them and submit a pull request!

## Contributing

Please do contribute to this repository, I only use so many languages so the
templates I provide are probably not the best. However, creating or modifying
templates is easy!

The poke script checks the file extension (Ex: Kevin__.java__) and looks for a 
matching file poke__.java__ in the `/tmpl` folder. When making templates, you
have access to a few variables:

| Variable  | Description |
| --------- | ------------- |
| $FILE     | The full filename with extension |
| $FNAME    | The filename without extension   |
| $DATE     | Date that the file was created   |
| $DIR      | The files current directory      |

See [poke.java](https://github.com/GleasonK/poke/blob/master/tmpl/poke.java)
for a good example of template creation.

Let me know if you have any suggestions for the future of this script!
